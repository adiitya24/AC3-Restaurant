        <h2>About AC3</h2>
        <p>
            Since our modest beginnings in 2023 with a little space in Mumbai , ‘AC3’ ‘s development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid, Indian-roused takeout food.

In contrast to other Indian eateries, ‘Ac3’ was made with the explicit expectation to appear as something else.
<br>
We realize numerous individuals love Indian sustenance, yet a large number of them loathe or are unconscious of the regularly unfortunate fixings that make run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment taste so great.
<br>
Our menu highlights things that utilize the sound and fragrant flavors, however, forget the stuffing ghee, spread, oil, and overwhelming cream.
We perceive that a few people are as yet searching for run-of-the-mill Indian nourishment, and that is fine with us. Our disclaimer is that on the off chance that you’re anticipating overwhelming, slick, undesirable Indian nourishment, Ac3 isn’t the place for you.     
<br>
The glass divider confronting the sea, unbiased shades, finished dividers, and excellent fine art, just as lavish tablecloths and seats, all contribute toward an extravagant ordeal. The earthenware and cutlery are just delightful.
